As a content creator and educator, I am constantly looking for awesome projects that I find useful and share them with the broader community. I am not the only one doing this. There are lots of people that share fun projects that they find interesting and useful. This is how projects go viral and gain lots of visibility. From my observation, there are a few components that make certain machine learning projects stand out from the rest. If your goal is to build a portfolio or create impactful and unique projects for the community, here are a few areas you can focus on to make your projects compelling and stand out from the rest.

# 1. Introduction

We live in a world where people are suffering from many diseases. Cancer is the most threatening of them all. Among all the variants of cancer, skin cancer is spreading rapidly. It happens because of the abnormal growth of skin cells. The increase in ultraviolet radiation on the Earth's surface is also helping skin cancer spread in every corner of the world. Benign and malignant types are the most common skin cancers people suffer from. People go through expensive and time-consuming treatments to cure skin cancer but yet fail to lower the mortality rate. To reduce the mortality rate, early detection of skin cancer in its incipient phase is helpful. <br /> In today's world, deep learning is being used to detect diseases. `The convolutional neural network (CNN)` helps to find skin cancer through image classification more accurately. We used CNN models and a comparison of their working processes for finding the best results .  <br /> 
In this dataset, there are 6594 images of benign and malignant skin cancer. Using different approaches: <br /> 
### We have gained accurate results for
>  VGG16 (93.18%)<br />
> SVM (83.48%)<br />
> ResNet50 (84.39%)<br />
> Sequential_Model_1 (74.24%)<br />
> Sequential_Model_2 (77.00%)<br />
> Sequential_Model_3 (84.09%) <br />
The `VGG16 model` has given us the highest accuracy of 93.18%.

# 2. Method and Methodology
For this research, many CNN models have been implemented. As CNN is mostly based on convolutional layers, models with different numbers of layers like SVM, VGG16, ResNet50, and sequential are used. All the models are applied to a single dataset. The dataset is prepared and trained with these models. The work process of these trained models has been distinguished by the accuracy acquired.
